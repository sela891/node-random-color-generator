# Node.js Random Color Generator

When a user enters `node index.js` in the command line, a block of 31x9 `#` characters colored with a random color (using hex code, e.g. `#ff0000`) is generated.

In addition to `node index.js`, a request for

- hue (eg. green or red or blue)
- luminosity (eg. light or dark)

is also accepted and random colors that match those choices are being generated.

## TODOs

- [] figure out how to receive command line arguments
- [] figure out how to print a block of 31x9 # characters with user input
- [] figure out how to get blocks of 31x9 # characters (library?)
- [] figure out how to randomize the color
- [] figure out how to add criteria for hue and luminosity
